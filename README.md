## Description
    
I endeavoured to build a command line application that allow users to build and manage a database of employees for a business.


This project allowed me to gain experience with database management and taking user input to manipulate a database.





In completing this project, I learned a great deal about SQL, building and manipulating databases, and working with ascynchronous functions.

## Installation
    
To use the employee tracker, clone the repository by running "git clone `git@github.com:the64man1/Employee-Tracker.git`' on your console. Then use the command 'npm install' to install the dependencies. Next you will need to create the 'employee_trackerdb' in MySQL by running a query in MySQL Workbench using the schema described in the 'schema.sql' file. Then you can run the command 'npm start' to begin using the Employee Tracker. Sample data is included in the seed.sql files.
